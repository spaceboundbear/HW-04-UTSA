# HW-04-UTSA


This one was extremely difficult, I wish I had more time to style the.css a bit more

This app is a short quiz that tests user knowledge on basic javascript. It asks a series of questions and for every correct question the user is given points in relation to the time left. If the user selects a wrong answer, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer. After the quiz is over, the user has the opportunity to log their highscore and compare it to other scores.

All buttons and functions work as intended, although I haven't had a chance to bug search.
